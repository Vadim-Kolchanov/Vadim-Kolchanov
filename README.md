# Hello world!<a href="https://github.com/Vadim-Kolchanov"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a> My name is Vadim Kolchanov

## ✨ About Me:

I’m a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing scalable enterprise applications. My core strength lies in Java (Spring Boot, Microservices, Kafka) and Kotlin, where I design and build systems that are both reliable and efficient. 

I have a bachelor's degree in fundamental physics (equivalent computer science). An example of my scientific activity can be found in an [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344861906) published in an international scientific journal. During my studies, I liked programming classes (we wrote in such languages as Pascal, C++, Matlab, Fortran, Mathematica, Python), so after graduation from the university I completely immersed myself in development. 

I enjoy working with great teams to deliver products that truly impact people’s lives. Legacy code doesn’t scare me I value clean architecture, SOLID principles, refactoring, and full unit-test coverage whenever possible.

Beyond coding, I share knowledge through technical articles, documenting my research and solutions to help other developers solve complex issues faster.

I believe effective collaboration is just as important as technical skills. My experience working closely with analysts and developers allows me to turn business needs into scalable backend solutions.

🎮 Outside of backend engineering, I’m passionate about game development (Unity, Roblox) and have also developed smart contracts for the Sui blockchain. These experiences fuel my curiosity and help me stay versatile as a developer.


## 🚀 My Projects

### 🧩 [Smart Contract on Sui Blockchain (Move)](https://github.com/Vadim-Kolchanov/smart-contract-for-SUI-blockchain)

Designed and implemented on-chain game mechanics using the **Move** language for the **Sui blockchain**.  
Created the **Battle of Races** module where players can create battles and securely redeem rewards.

**Key features:**
- Core smart contract logic with strong ownership & capability model  
- Event-driven architecture for off-chain indexing  
- TypeScript backend for deployment, testing & event subscriptions  
- Security-focused: deterministic coin flows, explicit object ownership  

> This project demonstrates my ability to combine blockchain engineering with backend systems using Move + TypeScript.
