### ‚ú® About Me:

I am a Backend Developer with 3+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications. 

I have a bachelor's degree in fundamental physics (equivalent computer science). An example of my scientific activity can be found in an [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344861906) published in an international scientific journal. During my studies, I liked programming classes (we wrote in such languages as Pascal, C++, Matlab, Fortran, Mathematica, Python), so after graduation from the university I completely immersed myself in development. 

At the beginning of my developer career, I worked as a Full Stack developer, solving business tasks for both the frontend and the backend, because, as a physicist, a programming language do not matter to me. However, with the increase in the number of technologies and the nuances of working with them, I decided to focus only on backend development.

### üíª My Opensource Story:

- [Java Enterprise Template](https://github.com/Vadim-Kolchanov/java-enterprise-template) - This project can help backend developers to start enterprise-level projects quickly, because the project has utilizes the best practices and design patterns for enterprise applications. Or they will be able to get something new for themselves.
